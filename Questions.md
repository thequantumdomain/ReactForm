Approach for Form Validation:

For form validation in React Native, I utilized a combination of React's useState hook for managing form state and a custom validation 
function triggered on input change and form submission.

State Management:

Used useState hook to manage state variables for name, email, phone number, and their respective error messages.

Validation Function:

Created a validate function that checks each field against defined rules (e.g., email format using regex, phone number length).

Handling Form State and Error Messages:

Linked onChange handlers to update state variables for each input field.
Displayed error messages conditionally based on state values.


Submitting Form Data to Backend Server:

Implemented a handleSubmit function that calls validate() to check form validity before proceeding.
If valid, prepared the data and made a POST request to the backend server using fetch or axios.

Summary:

Managed form state using React's useState hook.
Implemented validation logic using a custom validate function and displayed error messages conditionally.
Handled form submission by validating data, preparing it for backend submission, and making a POST request.
This approach ensures a robust form handling and validation process in React Native, adhering to best practices for user input and error management.

Code Explanation:
useState: Manages state variables for name, email, phone, and their respective error messages (nameError, emailError, phoneError).
validate function: Checks each field against validation rules (presence for name, email format using regex, phone number length).
handleSubmit function: Validates form data using validate() before submitting it to the backend server (https://example.com/api/form-submit in this example).
TextInput components: Controlled inputs that update state (value and onChangeText).
Button component: Triggers handleSubmit when pressed to initiate form submission.
Stylesheet: Defines styles for components (container, input fields, error messages).
This component provides a basic structure for handling forms with validation and submission in React Native, adhering to best practices
for state management and user input validation. Adjustments can be made based on specific backend requirements and additional validation needs.
